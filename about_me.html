<h2>How I Got To Play Professional Baseball</h2>
<p>My strange trip to playing baseball started with a dream and what I did and my my family did to help me achieve my goal. Remember, if you can throw a baseball, hit a baseball, run and will work hard., you can play baseball  if you believe in yourself.</p>
